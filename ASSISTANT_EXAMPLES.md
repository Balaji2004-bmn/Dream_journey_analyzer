### Conversation 2: General Knowledge
**User:** "What is React.js?"

**Assistant:** "React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. Key features:

1. **Component-based:** Build reusable UI components
2. **Virtual DOM:** Efficient rendering and updates
3. **JSX Syntax:** Write HTML-like code in JavaScript
4. **One-way data binding:** Predictable data flow
5. **Rich ecosystem:** Large community and tools

Fun fact: This Dream Journey platform is built with React! It helps create the smooth, interactive experience you're using right now. Would you like to know more about any specific React concept?"

### Conversation 3: Mixed Topics
**User:** "What does the premium plan include?"

**Assistant:** "The Premium plan ($10/month - ‚Çπ830) includes:
- Everything in Pro plan
- Video duration: up to 15 seconds (vs 10s in Pro)
- Early access to new features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Priority customer support

It's perfect if you want longer, more detailed dream story videos and access to cutting-edge features before everyone else!"

**User:** "Cool! By the way, what's a good way to remember dreams?"

**Assistant:** "Great question! Here are proven techniques to remember dreams better:

1. **Keep a dream journal** (which this platform helps with!)
2. **Set an intention** before sleep: "I will remember my dreams"
3. **Don't move** when you wake up - stay still and recall
4. **Write immediately** - dreams fade in minutes
5. **Get enough sleep** - REM cycles increase later in the night
6. **Avoid alcohol** - it disrupts REM sleep

Since you're using Dream Journey Analyzer, try logging your dreams right when you wake up. The act of writing them down actually trains your brain to remember more! üåô"
