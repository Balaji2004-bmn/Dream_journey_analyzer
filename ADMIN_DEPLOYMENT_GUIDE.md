# Admin Panel Access After Deployment

## ✅ Changes Made

Added admin routes to the main application (`src/App.jsx`):
- `/admin/auth` - Admin login page
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard

## 🌐 Accessing Admin Panel in Production

### After deploying your frontend to Netlify (or any hosting):

**Admin Login URL:**
```
https://your-deployed-site.netlify.app/admin/auth
```

**Admin Dashboard URL (after login):**
```
https://your-deployed-site.netlify.app/admin
```

## 🔑 Admin Credentials Setup

### 1. Configure Backend Environment Variables

Make sure your backend (deployed separately) has these environment variables:

```env
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-admin-email@gmail.com,another-admin@gmail.com
ADMIN_MASTER_PASSWORD=YourSecureAdminPassword123!
```

### 2. Deploy Your Backend

Your backend needs to be deployed and accessible. Options:
- **Render** (recommended for Node.js backends)
- **Railway**
- **Heroku**
- **AWS/DigitalOcean**

### 3. Update Frontend Environment Variables

In your Netlify deployment, add this environment variable:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
```

**How to add in Netlify:**
1. Go to your site in Netlify dashboard
2. Site settings → Environment variables
3. Add `VITE_BACKEND_URL` with your backend URL
4. Redeploy your site

## 🚀 Complete Deployment Flow

### Step 1: Deploy Backend
```bash
# Your backend must be running and accessible
# Example backend URL: https://dream-journey-api.onrender.com
```

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend
```bash
# Build your frontend
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (automatic via Git or manual)
```

### Step 3: Access Admin Panel
```
1. Navigate to: https://your-site.netlify.app/admin/auth
2. Enter admin email (from ADMIN_EMAILS)
3. Enter admin password (ADMIN_MASTER_PASSWORD)
4. You'll be redirected to /admin dashboard
```

## 📋 Admin Features Available

- **User Management**: View, activate, deactivate, ban users
- **Role Management**: Assign admin, moderator, user roles
- **System Insights**: View analytics, dream statistics, sentiment analysis
- **Content Moderation**: Monitor flagged content
- **Privacy Dashboard**: View consent and privacy statistics

## 🔧 Local Testing (Before Deployment)

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev    # Runs on port 3001

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev    # Runs on port 5173

# Access admin at: http://localhost:5173/admin/auth
```

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

1. **Never commit** `.env` files with real credentials
2. **Use strong passwords** for `ADMIN_MASTER_PASSWORD`
3. **Limit admin emails** to only trusted administrators
4. **Use HTTPS** in production (Netlify provides this automatically)
5. **Backend CORS**: Ensure backend allows requests from your Netlify domain

## 🛠️ Backend CORS Configuration

Your backend should allow requests from your Netlify domain:

```javascript
// backend/server.js
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5173',
    'http://localhost:5174',
    'https://your-site.netlify.app'  // Add your Netlify URL
  ],
  credentials: true
}));
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Admin page returns 404
- **Solution**: Ensure you've redeployed frontend after adding routes
- Check: Netlify build logs to ensure build was successful

### "Admin access required" error
- **Solution**: Check backend environment variables are set
- Verify: `ADMIN_EMAILS` includes your email
- Verify: `ADMIN_MASTER_PASSWORD` is set

### CORS errors
- **Solution**: Add your Netlify domain to backend CORS whitelist
- Redeploy backend after making changes

### Backend not responding
- **Solution**: Check backend deployment is running
- Verify: `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in Netlify env variables is correct
