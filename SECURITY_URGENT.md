# üö® URGENT SECURITY NOTICE

## Your API Keys Were Exposed!

Your `.gitignore` file was **missing**, which means your `.env` file with **real API keys** could have been committed to git at any time.

### ‚úÖ What I Fixed:
- Created a proper `.gitignore` file
- Added `.env` files to ignore list
- Your secrets are now protected from git

### üîê What YOU Need to Do NOW:

#### 1. Check if You Pushed to GitHub/GitLab
```bash
git remote -v
```

**If you see a remote URL (GitHub, GitLab, etc.):**
- Your API keys may have been exposed publicly!
- You MUST regenerate them immediately (see below)

**If no remote or you never pushed:**
- You're probably safe, but still follow best practices below

#### 2. Rotate Your API Keys (RECOMMENDED)

Even though your `.env` wasn't committed, it's best practice to rotate keys:

**Gemini API Key:**
1. Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Delete the old key: `AIzaSyA1m-IXUzQDwN20eBljJgNZ57uNYWf9TF8`
3. Create a new one
4. Update `backend/.env` with the new key

**OpenAI API Key:**
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Delete the exposed key (starts with `sk-proj-NOHL250Z...`)
3. Create a new one
4. Update `backend/.env` with the new key

#### 3. Verify .gitignore is Working
```bash
# This should show NOTHING:
git status backend/.env

# If it shows the file, run:
git rm --cached backend/.env
git rm --cached .env
```

#### 4. Never Commit .env Files
- ‚úÖ DO: Commit `.env.example` (with fake values)
- ‚ùå DON'T: Commit `.env` (with real secrets)
- ‚úÖ DO: Keep `.gitignore` updated
- ‚ùå DON'T: Share API keys in screenshots/messages

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables Checklist:
- [x] `.gitignore` includes `.env` and `**/.env`
- [ ] Rotate API keys if pushed to remote
- [ ] Use `.env.example` for documentation
- [ ] Never hardcode secrets in code
- [ ] Use environment variables only

### What's in Your .env File:
- ‚ùå **Gemini API Key**: `AIzaSyA1m-IXUzQDwN20eBljJgNZ57uNYWf9TF8` 
- ‚ùå **OpenAI API Key**: `sk-proj-NOHL250Z...` (partial)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Both need to be kept secret!

### If Keys Were Exposed Publicly:
1. **Immediately revoke** the keys
2. Check for unauthorized API usage
3. Generate new keys
4. Update all environments
5. Monitor for suspicious activity

## üîç Check Git History

To see if `.env` was ever committed:
```bash
# Check current staging:
git status

# Check if .env is in history:
git log --all --full-history -- backend/.env
git log --all --full-history -- .env

# If it shows commits, you MUST rotate keys!
```

## ‚úÖ You're Protected Now

Your new `.gitignore` file will prevent this from happening again. Just remember to:
1. Never delete `.gitignore`
2. Rotate keys if you pushed to remote
3. Keep secrets in `.env` only
4. Always check `git status` before committing
